<!-- Hello there, prospective issue reporter! Your bug reports are
     very valuable üíõ.  They really are, and Eglot couldn't be made
     without them.  But there are lots of bugs and so little time.  So

        PLEASE - DO NOT - REMOVE OR SKIP PARTS OF THIS TEMPLATE.
  
     üëâüèΩ Need help configuring or understanding Emacs, Eglot, or LSP?
     Have an idea for a feature?  Please DON'T OPEN A NEW ISSUE!
  
     * Head to https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions to
       discuss.  Start a new discussion, there are no templates there,
       you can say whatever you want.
  
     * You can also make an Emacs bug report, which can also be used
       for general discussion.  You'll potentially reach more people
       this way.  You can do it via `M-x report-emacs-bug` or just
       send email to `bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org`.  Be sure to `CC:` (or
       better, `X-Debbugs-CC:` ) Eglot's maintainer, currently
       `joaotavora@gmail.com`.
  
     To make an issue, you need to provide some elements, which aren't
     hard to find.  Can't find all the elements for this template?
     No problem, just make a discussion üëÜ.
     
     If you don't provide the needed elements, WE MAY CLOSE THE ISSUE
     JUST LIKE THAT üòê . -->
     
* Server used:               <!-- (clangd, gopls, etc..) -->
* Emacs version:             <!-- Type M-x emacs-version -->
* Operating system:          <!-- (windows/mac osx/linux/don't know -->
* Eglot version:             <!-- Look in M-x list-packages or tell Git SHA -->
* Eglot installation method:       <!-- Git/package.el/straight/use-package/don't know -->
* Using Doom:                <!-- Yes/No -->

#### LSP transcript - M-x eglot-events-buffer (mandatory unless Emacs inoperable)
<!-- DO NOT SKIP OR REMOVE: Include the invaluable LSP transcript .
     Inside Emacs, you can display that buffer with the M-x
     eglot-events-buffer command. It contains the JSONRPC messages
     exchanged between client and server, as well as the messages the
     server prints to stderr.  Copy that text and paste it below as a
     formatted code block
     (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)). -->
     
```lisp
... Paste the events transcript here ...  Try to start from the line that says
[client-request] (id:1) Sat Apr 10 21:40:09 2021:
(:jsonrpc "2.0" :id 1 :method "initialize" :params ...
```
    
#### Backtrace (mandatory, unless no error message seen or heard):
<!-- DO NOT SKIP OR REMOVE: If Emacs errored (you saw -- and possibly
     heard -- an error message), make sure you repeat the process
     after enabling backtraces with `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`.  The
     backtrace buffer contains text that you should also include here,
     again as a formatted code block. -->
     
```lisp
... Paste the backtrace here ...
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "oh no")
  signal(error ("oh no"))
  error("oh no")
  eval((error "oh no") nil)
  pp-eval-expression((error "oh no"))
  funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "oh no"))
  call-interactively(pp-eval-expression nil nil)
  command-execute(pp-eval-expression)
```
   
#### Minimal configuration (mandatory)
<!-- DO NOT SKIP OR REMOVE: Are you using Doom Emacs or Spacemacs
     Emacs or some very special pimped-out Emacs?  That's fine, but
     for this report we need to be able to replicate the problem JUST
     AS IT HAPPENED TO YOU.  We can't replicate your complex
     configuration and environment, so you need to provide a MINIMAL,
     REPRODUCIBLE and COMPLETE recipe.
     
     How to do this? Here's the easiest way provided you can use the
     shell in your system:-->
     
 ```sh
 # Type this in a shell to start an Emacs with Eglot configured
 $ /path/to/a/certain/version/of/emacs -Q -f package-initialize -L /path/to/git-cloned/eglot -l eglot.el 
 ```
 
 ```lisp
 ;; Example of a minimal init.el configuration
 ;;
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(foo-mode "foo-server"))
 (setq eglot-special-option-2000 '(foo bar with the airplane)) 
 (some-clearly-identified-third-party-package)
  ```
 
 <!-- WHEW!!
 
      For some bugs, all this may seem like overkill but believe us,
      very often what seems like a "clear issue" is actually specific
      to some details of your setup. Having a runnable reproduction
      not only "proves" your bug to us but also allows us to spend all
      our effort fixing the bug instead of struggling to understand
      your issue.
 
      Anyway, after you've launched Emacs + Eglot that please explain
      what options you clicked on or what commands you entered, in a
      way that is clear to the Eglot maintainers so they can replicate
      the problem JUST AS IT HAPPENED TO YOU.
      
      If this requires some bits of .emacs or init.el configuration,
      you need to add them (just as in the example above)
      
      If reproducing your error requires others files and or programs,
      you NEED TO ADD snippets for them or provide links to them.

      Some users also provide whole Git repositories perfectly
      "sandboxing" a configuration and setup.  If you're confident on
      how do to this, that also works.
      
      Thank you very much.
